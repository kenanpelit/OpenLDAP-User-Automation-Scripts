These are scripts I used to add and delete OpenLDAP accounts. Not for anything beyond causal use. :)

addldapuser.sh - adds the user after being prompted for the password
usage: addldapuser.sh <gidNumber> <username>

delldapuser.sh - deletes user.
config - the config file the automation scripts reads off from
secret - the ldap password file
